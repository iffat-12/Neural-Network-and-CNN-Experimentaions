## **CIFAR-10 Image Classification using NN and CNN**
### **Overview**
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The models implemented include Regular Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Various hyperparameters and architectures were tested to improve model performance.

### **Dataset**
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### **Dependencies**
* numpy
* tensorflow
* keras
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
### **Model Architectures**
**Regular Neural Network (NN)**
A simple feedforward neural network with two dense layers and dropout regularization.
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
A CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, dense layers, and dropout regularization.
